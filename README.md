# STL Import Function Example for NVIDIA Modulus

## Overview
This repository provides an example of how to implement an STL import function using the NVIDIA Modulus package (nvidia-modulus-sym). This example is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate the integration of STL file import functionality within the NVIDIA Modulus framework.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

NVIDIA Modulus Sym: This package provides symbolic mathematics and is required for this example. Install it using:

```Bash
pip install nvidia-modulus-sym
```
In my case, there is a dependency that is not automatically installed. So, you need to install it yourself.
```Bash
pip install warp-lang
```
STL File: You need an STL file that you want to import. STL files are commonly used for 3D models and are typically used in computational simulations.

## Example Code
See an example code 'main.py' that demonstrates how to import an STL file using NVIDIA Modulus. This code will help you understand how to load and process STL files in the context of a Modulus-based project. This Example will be look familiar if you have seen the example on the modulus-sym before. I just modified how if it load from STL file rather that creating the new geometry. The other code is left as it is. Please find the pre-make stl files as 'bracket.stl'

## Additional Notes
This example assumes a simple use case for illustration purposes. In practice, you may need to adapt the code to handle specific details of your simulation or geometry processing.
Make sure to check the NVIDIA Modulus documentation for more advanced usage and integration with the Modulus ecosystem.
